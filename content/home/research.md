Should governments in developing countries promote technology adoption, or should they support innovation? To answer this question, we use a newly digitized dataset on technology import and patents in South Korea. We find that 1) as firms closing technology gap from foreign firms, productivity growth from adoption decreases compared with innovation, 2) the adoption fee is higher when the gap is smaller, 3) when a firm adopts a technology, other firms increase patent citations to the adopted technology, suggesting knowledge diffusion. Based on these findings, we build a two-country growth model where firms can innovate or adopt technology from foreign firms. A novel feature of the model is that foreign firms lose future profit when sharing the technology and internalize the loss by charging an adoption fee. Adoption creates intertemporal spillover, which motivates the government to subsidize adoption, but the size of the spillover decreases as the country grows. Then, we calibrate the model by matching the empirical findings. Using the calibrated model, we decompose the contribution of adoption and innovation over different stages of development. Furthermore, we evaluate the technology policy in Korea, which started with an adoption subsidy and switched to an innovation subsidy. Our result suggests that switching from adoption to innovation subsidy generates higher welfare than alternatives.
