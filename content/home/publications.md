    <div class="expand-content" style="display: none; font-size:90%"> Should governments in developing countries promote technology adoption or encourage innovation? We use a newly digitized dataset on technology imports and patents in South Korea to answer this question. Empirically, we find that when firms are closer to foreign firms in terms of productivity, 1) the adoption fee is higher, 2) the productivity gain from adoption is smaller compared with innovation, and 3) firms are more likely to innovate than adopt technologies. Based on these findings, we build a two-country growth model with innovation and adoption. When a firm sells technology to another firm, it loses future profit and internalizes the loss by charging an endogenous adoption fee. Adoption and innovation generate knowledge diffusion and its size changes over development stages, which motivates state-dependent policies. After estimating the model on the microdata, we evaluate Korea's technology policy, which started with an adoption subsidy and switched to an innovation subsidy. Our result suggests that the policy increased consumption-equivalent welfare by 4.84% than the case without any subsidies, which is higher than subsidizing only innovation or adoption. We then find that it was optimal to switch from an adoption to an innovation subsidy when Korea's GDP reached 60% of Japan's. </div>

      </span>
    </div>
    <div class="expand-content" style="display: none; font-size:90%">This paper measures innovation on tools used by different occupations and studies
its impact on the increasing skill premium. First, we match the description of tools
from Wikipedia with patent text data using textual analysis to measure the innovation
on tools. Then, we study its relation with the labor market variables at the occupation
level. We find 1) innovation on tools grew more in skill-intensive occupations, 2) it
is positively associated with wage and employment growth across occupations, 3) it
is positively correlated with the skill premium and skill intensity growth within each
occupation. Motivated by this reduced-form evidence, we build a model where tool
innovation increases the demand of occupations, potentially more for skilled workers.
Parameters are estimated through the Generalized Method of Moments. We find that
tool innovation accounts for 61% of the total demand factor that contributed to the
skill premium increase in 1980-2015. </div>

    </div>
    <div class="expand-content" style="display: none; font-size:90%">We study how the adoption of foreign technology and local spillovers from such adoption contributed to late industrialization in a developing country during the postwar period. Using novel historical firm-level data for South Korea, we provide causal evidence of direct productivity gains to adopters and local productivity spillovers of the adoption. Based on these empirical findings, we develop a dynamic spatial model with firms' technology adoption decisions and local spillovers. The spillovers induce dynamic complementarity in firms' technology adoption decisions. Because of this dynamic complementarity, the model potentially features multiple steady states. Temporary adoption subsidies can have permanent effects by moving an economy to a new transition path that converges to a higher-productivity steady state. We calibrate our model to the microdata and econometric estimates. We evaluate the effects of the South Korean government policy that temporarily provided adoption subsidies to heavy manufacturing firms in the 1970s. Had no adoption subsidies been provided, South Korea would have converged to a less industrialized steady state in which the heavy manufacturing's share of GDP would have been 15% lower and aggregate welfare would have been 10% lower than the steady state with successful industrialization. Thus, temporary subsidies for technology adoption had permanent effects. </div>
