**Abstract :** This paper measures innovation on tools used by different occupations and studies
its impact on the increasing skill premium. First, we match the description of tools
from Wikipedia with patent text data using textual analysis to measure the innovation
on tools. Then, we study its relation with the labor market variables at the occupation
level. We find 1) innovation on tools grew more in skill-intensive occupations, 2) it
is positively associated with wage and employment growth across occupations, 3) it
is positively correlated with the skill premium and skill intensity growth within each
occupation. Motivated by this reduced-form evidence, we build a model where tool
innovation increases the demand of occupations, potentially more for skilled workers.
Parameters are estimated through the Generalized Method of Moments. We nd that
tool innovation accounts for 61% of the total demand factor that contributed to the
skill premium increase in 1980-2015.
