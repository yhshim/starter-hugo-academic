    <div class="expand-content" style="display: none; font-size:90%"> Should governments in developing countries prioritize supporting technology adoption or promoting innovation? We use a newly digitized dataset on technology imports and patents in South Korea to answer this question. Empirically, we find that when the productivity gap between domestic and foreign firms is smaller, 1) the adoption fee is higher, 2) the productivity gain from adoption is smaller compared with innovation, and 3) firms are more likely to innovate than adopt technologies. Motivated by these findings, we build a two-country growth model with endogenous adoption and innovation decisions. Foreign firms sell technology for an endogenous fee, internalizing the future loss of profit due to stronger competition with domestic firms. The endogenous fee makes firms invest less in adoption, motivating governments to subsidize adoption at the early stage of development. As domestic firms catch up with foreign firms, productivity gain from adoption diminishes, making adoption subsidy less effective. After estimating the model on the transition with microdata, we evaluate Korea's technology policy since 1973, which started with an adoption subsidy and switched to an innovation subsidy. Our result suggests that the actual policy increased consumption-equivalent welfare by 4.84%, which is higher than subsidizing only innovation or adoption. </div>

**How Task-Biased is Capital-Embodied Innovation?**

    </div>
    <div class="expand-content" style="display: none; font-size:90%">This paper develops a measure of Capital-Embodied Innovation (CEI). The measure counts the number of patents applied to different capital goods by matching patent descriptions from the USPTO to capital goods descriptions from Wikipedia. Using occupation-level variations on the sets of capital goods from O*NET, we document that the CEI measure is smaller for routine occupations. Furthermore, we highlight the heterogeneous effects of CEI across the capital good-occupation relationship. When the capital good performs the same function as the occupational task (task-substituting capital), the CEI on the capital good reduces the relative demand for labor. In case the capital good performs a different function than the occupation tasks (task-complementing capital), the CEI raises relative demand for labor. Abstract occupations have disproportionately more CEI on task-complementing capital than non-abstract occupations. A model-based counterfactual implies that the employment growth between the 1980s and the 2010s would be 33% less biased towards abstract task occupations without the CEI. The degree of job polarization and occupational wage inequality would have been lower without the CEI. </div>

    </div>
    <div class="expand-content" style="display: none; font-size:90%">We study how the adoption of foreign technology and local spillovers from such adoption contributed to late industrialization in a developing country during the postwar period. Using novel historical firm-level data for South Korea, we provide causal evidence of direct productivity gains to adopters and local productivity spillovers of the adoption. Based on these empirical findings, we develop a dynamic spatial model with firms' technology adoption decisions and local spillovers. The spillovers induce dynamic complementarity in firms' technology adoption decisions. Because of this dynamic complementarity, the model potentially features multiple steady states. Temporary adoption subsidies can have permanent effects by moving an economy to a new transition path that converges to a higher-productivity steady state. We calibrate our model to the microdata and econometric estimates. We evaluate the effects of the South Korean government policy that temporarily provided adoption subsidies to heavy manufacturing firms in the 1970s. Had no adoption subsidies been provided, South Korea would have converged to a less industrialized steady state in which the heavy manufacturing's share of GDP would have been 15% lower and aggregate welfare would have been 10% lower than the steady state with successful industrialization. Thus, temporary subsidies for technology adoption had permanent effects. </div>
