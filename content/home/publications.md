<font size="3">Should governments in developing countries promote technology adoption, or should they support innovation? To answer this question, we use a newly digitized dataset on technology import and patents in South Korea. We find that 1) as firms closing technology gap from foreign firms, productivity growth from adoption decreases compared with innovation, 2) the adoption fee is higher when the gap is smaller, 3) when a firm adopts a technology, other firms increase patent citations to the adopted technology, suggesting knowledge diffusion. Based on these findings, we build a two-country growth model where firms can innovate or adopt technology from foreign firms. A novel feature of the model is that foreign firms lose future profit when sharing the technology and internalize the loss by charging an adoption fee. Adoption creates intertemporal spillover, which motivates the government to subsidize adoption, but the size of the spillover decreases as the country grows. Then, we calibrate the model by matching the empirical findings. Using the calibrated model, we decompose the contribution of adoption and innovation over different stages of development. Furthermore, we evaluate the technology policy in Korea, which started with an adoption subsidy and switched to an innovation subsidy. Our result suggests that switching from adoption to innovation subsidy generates higher welfare than alternatives.</font></p>

<font size="3">This paper measures innovation on tools used by different occupations and studies
its impact on the increasing skill premium. First, we match the description of tools
from Wikipedia with patent text data using textual analysis to measure the innovation
on tools. Then, we study its relation with the labor market variables at the occupation
level. We find 1) innovation on tools grew more in skill-intensive occupations, 2) it
is positively associated with wage and employment growth across occupations, 3) it
is positively correlated with the skill premium and skill intensity growth within each
occupation. Motivated by this reduced-form evidence, we build a model where tool
innovation increases the demand of occupations, potentially more for skilled workers.
Parameters are estimated through the Generalized Method of Moments. We find that
tool innovation accounts for 61% of the total demand factor that contributed to the
skill premium increase in 1980-2015.</font></p>

   <font size="3"><p> We study how the adoption of foreign technology and local spillovers from such adoption contributed to late industrialization in a developing country during the postwar period. Using novel historical firm-level data for South Korea, we provide causal evidence of direct productivity gains to adopters and local productivity spillovers of the adoption. Based on these empirical findings, we develop a dynamic spatial model with firms' technology adoption decisions and local spillovers. The spillovers induce dynamic complementarity in firms' technology adoption decisions. Because of this dynamic complementarity, the model potentially features multiple steady states. Temporary adoption subsidies can have permanent effects by moving an economy to a new transition path that converges to a higher-productivity steady state. We calibrate our model to the microdata and econometric estimates. We evaluate the effects of the South Korean government policy that temporarily provided adoption subsidies to heavy manufacturing firms in the 1970s. Had no adoption subsidies been provided, South Korea would have converged to a less industrialized steady state in which the heavy manufacturing's share of GDP would have been 15% lower and aggregate welfare would have been 10% lower than the steady state with successful industrialization. Thus, temporary subsidies for technology adoption had permanent effects. </p></font>
